============

> A PhoneGap frontend to node-chat

## About the App

This is a complete PhoneGap project that acts as a client to the server in node-chat.

## Run the Server first

For this project to run successfully, an instance of the node-chat server needs to be running on an accessible IP.

## Before you can connect to the Server

Like in node-chat, the client JavaScript file needs to contain the proper IP for the server. Along with this, you need to whitelist the server IP in Cordova.plist. To do this, add the IP to Root/ExternalHosts.

That's it!
